# Next-agent handoff

Updated: 2026-09-19. Review: at the start and end of the next work session. Owner: Implementation agent; product choices belong to the user.

## Current state

MVP-01 through MVP-07 pass within their recorded scopes. [MVP-08 packaging and resource evidence](validation/2026-09-19-mvp08-packaging-resources.md) conditionally passes Windows NativeAOT, Linux static-musl interactive/systemd, and rootless Podman. The current static Linux server/admin retain the 76 Git/API/project-creation and 36 recovery assertions. [Static systemd evidence](validation/2026-09-19-static-systemd.md) records the explicit NativeAOT notification path and complete WSL rerun.

`src/Graft.Operations` now owns the offline maintenance lease, SHA-256 backup manifest, SQLite snapshot, safe repository-tree copying, verification, restore and Git bundle inventory. `src/Graft.Admin` exposes `bootstrap`, `backup`, `verify`, `restore` and `inspect-bundle` commands and publishes under NativeAOT. The server holds exclusive database and repository leases for its lifetime, so maintenance fails while it is running.

`Graft.Admin bootstrap` creates the first administrator from a protected password file while holding both maintenance leases. The 41-assertion operations workflow proves live-server exclusion, login, administrator status, hashed-at-rest storage and one-use refusal with both managed and Windows NativeAOT administration binaries.

The authenticated product exposes administrator-only ordinary-user creation, project-owner membership management and user-managed personal access tokens. A user chooses explicit scopes and a 1–365 day lifetime, sees the random secret once, lists active token metadata and revokes only their own tokens. The current Git/API/browser harness passes 107 assertions under the runtime and Windows NativeAOT server; it proves a browser-created token authenticates real Git HTTPS and fails immediately after revocation. Rendered MCPHub Chromium also passes token creation and revocation.

The import evidence is deliberately repository-only. A C# bundle parser inventories branches/tags and emits eight explicit excluded metadata categories. Git 2.53.0.windows.2 imports the repository through the supported HTTPS route; repeating the import preserves the same refs and object IDs and leaves the source unchanged. This is not a GitLab API/export metadata importer.

Backups use a consistent SQLite backup plus the complete repository tree. Every file and directory is inventoried; files are hashed. Links/reparse points, undeclared paths, tampering, live-server backup and existing restore targets are rejected. Restore verifies before publishing fresh targets and removes a database published before a later failure. The rollback rehearsal uses a synthetic incompatible schema change and a second fresh restore. Online backup, cross-process clusters and power-loss atomicity across separate database/repository paths remain outside the evidence.

The main release gates are the durable DnaX package source, a real CA/DNS/client-trust environment and integrated static-musl execution on the required Linux 3.10.108 host. The user deferred the legacy-host run for now. Windows Service, local operator-managed certificate loading, restart/replacement, systemd and container secret plumbing pass. A GitLab 18.0.0 source-backed project-creation fixture now passes against both Graft and a live GitLab CE 18.0.0 reference. Pinned `glab` 1.58.0 API workflows pass against both services. The production Blazor workflow now passes [rendered Chromium validation](validation/2026-09-19-browser-ui.md); that run found and fixed an invalid project-path HTML pattern.

Private project creation now passes through both the Blazor session API and the bounded GitLab-style REST route. The write route requires `api`, creates an empty durable repository through pending/ready publication, and rejects duplicates, invalid paths, unsupported visibility, and unsupported fields. A pinned GitLab 18.0.0 source fixture added path-only creation and raises the combined Windows JIT and NativeAOT harness to 87 assertions; see [source-fixture evidence](validation/2026-09-19-gitlab-18-source-fixture.md) and [live-reference evidence](validation/2026-09-19-gitlab-18-live-reference.md).

No remote is configured. Do not deploy, publish, import production data, expose a network listener or select repository visibility without explicit authorization.

## Next work

Keep the recorded static-musl server/admin pair available for the deferred Linux 3.10.108 run. Add authenticated password change and administrator password-reset/user-disable workflows so temporary credentials have an operational lifecycle. Validate the intended CA-issued certificate, DNS, client trust and renewal path before non-loopback deployment.

Continue to use the ignored reproducible DnaX feed until the user or DnaX maintainer selects an approved durable package source. Do not substitute a server-side Git executable or native Git library.

## Follow-on queue

| Work | Owner | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account credential lifecycle | Implementation agent | User changes a temporary password; administrator resets or disables an account; active sessions and tokens follow the documented revocation policy |
| Deployment TLS trust | Operator + implementation agent | Intended CA certificate, DNS/SAN, client trust and renewal rehearsal |
| Required legacy host | Implementation agent + user | Integrated static-musl artifact inspected and run on Linux 3.10.108 with sanitized evidence |
| DnaX distribution | User/DnaX maintainer | Clean checkout restores without a sibling source tree or locally prepared feed |

Recommended next action: Owner: Implementation agent — add password change and administrator reset/disable workflows. Remaining release gates: deployment CA/DNS trust, DnaX distribution and the deferred Linux 3.10.108 MVP-08 run.
